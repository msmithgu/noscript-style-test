  When building html views with javascript, I often use styled-to-be-hidden,
existing simple structure to create a fancy view.  In order to avoid
strangeness at client loading time, I hide it using css.  However, people
that have css enabled and javascript disabled won't be able to see anything.

  So this is a test of an idea to put alternative styling in noscript tags
and it appears to work in all the major browsers.
